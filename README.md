## Information 

Flask and Python used for the back-end along with Postgresql. 




## Installation 

 Make your way to the directory that contains the project. 

You first have to enter the Virtual Environment 

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

In order to set up the environment you need to do the following command once you are in the venv. 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The above step is a wip, needs to have dependencies updated. Please do ```pip install``` for each dependency (you can copy paste the current requirements.txt)


Postgresql will need to be installed and instantiated with tables as mentioned int he project.sql.

Next, run app.py 


```
python app.py
```

Project should then be accessible.
